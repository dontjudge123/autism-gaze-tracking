# Autism gaze tracking
Gaze tracking and pupillometry-based screening tool for autism research. This project is for my University course Collaborative systems. 
This project explores the use of gaze tracking and pupillometry to support early diagnostics for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It combines basic computer vision techniques with eye movement data analysis to detect patterns commonly observed in individuals with ASD.
